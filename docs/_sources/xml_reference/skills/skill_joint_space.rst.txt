Parameters
==========

**Basic** parameters:

  | **robot** : dict
  |  Robot that is controlled by the skill (only needs to be set at the application level).

**Expert** parameters:

  | **skill_name** : string
  |  Name of this skill. Must be locally unique.

  |  Contains the task description(s).

  | **bounds** : list:bound
  |  Contains the bounds description(s).

  | **monitors** : list:monitor

  | **scripts** : list:script
  |  Contains scripts that should be executed while the skill is active.

**Hidden** parameters:

  | **collections** : list:collection
  |  Contains the kinematic chains of the skill (feature, robot, object chains).
  |  **Default**: odict_keys(['base_to_eef'])

  | **loops** : list:kinematic_loop
  |  Contains the kinematic loop(s) that define the task to be solved.
  |  **Default**: odict_keys(['kinematic_loop'])
